Hi! I need some help with my upcoming flights. I’d like to cancel two of my reservations and upgrade another one to business class. Can you assist me with that?

<think>
Okay, let's break down what the user needs. They want to cancel two reservations and upgrade another to business class. First, I need to gather the necessary information.

For cancellation, the user must provide their user ID and reservation IDs. Since they mentioned two reservations, I'll need to ask for each reservation ID separately. Also, the reason for cancellation is required. The policy states that if any flight has already taken off, cancellation isn't possible, so I might need to check flight statuses, but the user hasn't provided those details yet.

Upgrading to business class involves modifying the reservation. The user needs to provide the reservation ID for the one they want to upgrade. The policy says that if the flight has already been flown, modification isn't allowed. So I should check the flight status for that reservation as well. Also, changing the cabin class might affect the price, and the user might need to pay the difference. I should confirm if they want to proceed with the upgrade and handle the payment method if necessary.

I should start by asking for the user's ID. Then, request the reservation IDs for both the ones they want to cancel and the one to upgrade. Also, ask for the reasons for cancellation. Once I have that info, I can proceed to check flight statuses and handle each request step by step, ensuring compliance with the policy.
</think>

I'll need some details to assist you. First, could you please provide your user ID? Also, please share the reservation IDs for the two reservations you want to cancel and the one you'd like to upgrade to business class. Additionally, could you let me know the reasons for canceling the flights?

Sure! My user ID is aarav_ahmed_6699. The reservations I want to cancel are IFOYYZ and NQNU5R. The one I’d like to upgrade to business class is M20IZO. I just need to cancel the first two because my plans have changed.

<think>
Okay, let's break down what the user needs. They want to cancel two reservations (IFOYYZ and NQNU5R) and upgrade another (M20IZO) to business class. 

First, I need to handle the cancellations. According to the policy, before cancelling, I must check if any part of the flight has been flown. The user mentioned the reason is a change of plan, which is allowed if the booking was made within 24 hours, the flight is cancelled by the airline, it's a business flight, or they have travel insurance. Since the user hasn't provided the booking time or insurance details, I might need to ask for more info. But the policy says I should transfer to a human agent if I can't handle it. Wait, but the user hasn't provided the reservation details yet. Wait, the user provided the reservation IDs, so maybe I should first check the status of those flights.

Wait, the policy says that if any portion of the flight has already been flown, cancellation isn't possible. So I need to check the status of each flight in the reservations IFOYYZ and NQNU5R. To do that, I should use the get_flight_status function for each reservation's flights. But the user hasn't specified which dates or flights are in those reservations. Hmm, maybe I need to get the reservation details first using get_reservation_details for each reservation ID. That way, I can check the flight status.

But the user hasn't provided the dates for the flights. Wait, the reservation details would include the flights' information, including dates. So first, I should call get_reservation_details for each reservation ID to get the flight details. Then, check the status of each flight. If any flight is already flown (status 'flying'), cancellation isn't possible. Otherwise, proceed.

But the user wants to cancel the reservations. So the steps would be:

1. For each reservation to cancel (IFOYYZ and NQNU5R), get their details to check flight status.
2. If any flight is 'flying', transfer to human.
3. Otherwise, proceed to cancel, but need to confirm with the user if they want to proceed after checking the cancellation rules (like time frame, insurance, etc.).

But the user hasn't provided the reason for cancellation yet. Wait, the user said "my plans have changed," which is a valid reason. However, the policy states that cancellation is allowed if the booking was made within 24 hours, flight is cancelled by airline, business flight, or travel insurance covers the reason. Since the user hasn't mentioned any of these, except their own reason, I need to check if the booking was within 24 hours. But without the booking time, I can't confirm. So maybe I need to get the reservation details to check the created time.

Alternatively, the policy says that if the user provides the reservation ID, the agent should help locate it. So first, get_reservation_details for each reservation to check the flight status and created time. Then, determine if cancellation is possible. If not, transfer. If possible, proceed.

But the user also wants to upgrade reservation M20IZO to business class. For that, I need to check if any flight in that reservation has already been flown. If not, then proceed to change the cabin class. But the policy says that cabin can't be changed if any flight has been flown. So again, need to check the flight status for M20IZO's flights.

So the plan is:

1. For each reservation (IFOYYZ, NQNU5R, M20IZO), get their details to check flight status and other info.
2. For cancellations (IFOYYZ and NQNU5R):
   a. Check if any flight is 'flying'. If yes, transfer.
   b. If not, check if cancellation is allowed based on the reason and other factors. If allowed, proceed to cancel.
3. For upgrade (M20IZO):
   a. Check if any flight is 'flying'. If yes, transfer.
   b. If not, check if cabin can be changed (which it can, as long as flights aren't flown). Then proceed to update cabin to business class.

But the user hasn't provided the dates for the flights. Wait, the reservation details would include the flights' dates. So first, I need to get the reservation details for each reservation ID. Let's start with that.

So first, call get_reservation_details for IFOYYZ, NQNU5R, and M20IZO. Then, based on the response, check the flight status and proceed accordingly.

But the user might not have provided all the necessary info, so I need to make sure to get the details first. However, the user might not know the exact dates, but the reservation details should have that info. So the first step is to retrieve the reservation details for each reservation ID.
