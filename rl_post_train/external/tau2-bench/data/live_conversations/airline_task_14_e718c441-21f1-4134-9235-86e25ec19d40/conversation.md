Hi! I’d like to check the balances on my gift cards and certificates, please. Can you tell me how much I have on each, and also the total amounts for both?

Okay, the user wants to check the balances on their gift cards and certificates. Let me see what tools I have available.

Looking at the functions provided, there's 'get_user_details' which retrieves user information, including payment methods. That might have the gift card balances. Also, 'send_certificate' is there, but that's for sending certificates, not checking balances. Wait, maybe 'get_user_details' will list all payment methods, including gift cards and certificates. The user's profile includes payment methods, so that's probably where the balances are stored.

But wait, the user is asking for the total amounts for both gift cards and certificates. The 'get_user_details' function might return all payment methods, so I can sum the gift cards and certificates from that data. However, the function parameters only require the user_id, which the user hasn't provided yet. The user hasn't given their user ID, so I need to ask for that first. 

Wait, the policy says that before any actions that update the booking database, I need to list the action details and get explicit confirmation. But in this case, checking balances isn't an action that updates the database. However, the user hasn't provided their user ID yet. So I need to ask them for their user ID to proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe the user's payment methods are already known, but the user hasn't provided the user ID. So the first step is to request the user ID. Once I have that, I can call 'get_user_details' to retrieve their payment methods and calculate the totals. 

So the correct step is to ask the user for their user ID. Then, using that, fetch the payment methods and sum the gift cards and certificates. But since the user hasn't given the user ID yet, I can't proceed without it. Therefore, I should prompt the user to provide their user ID first.

I need your user ID to check your gift card and certificate balances. Could you please provide your user ID?

Okay, the user wants to check their gift card and certificate balances. They provided their user ID: mohamed_silva_9265.

First, I need to retrieve their user details. The policy says that before any actions that update the booking database, I must list the action details and get user confirmation. But in this case, the user is just checking balances, which is part of their profile info. The get_user_details function should provide that information.

So, I should call get_user_details with the user_id they provided. That function will return their payment methods, including gift cards and certificates. Then I can extract the balances from there. 

Wait, the user mentioned gift cards and certificates. The payment methods in the profile include credit card, gift card, and travel certificate. The get_user_details function should list all payment methods under the user's profile. Each payment method would have an amount, I assume. 

Once I get the details, I can sum the gift cards and certificates separately and provide the total. The user also wants the total amounts for both. So, after retrieving the data, I'll calculate the sum of gift cards and the sum of certificates, then add them for the total. 

I need to make sure that the response includes each individual balance, the total for gift cards, the total for certificates, and the overall total. Let me structure the response once I have the data from the function call.

### step=5 ASSISTANT

<think>
Okay, let me process the user's request. They wanted to check the balances on their gift cards and certificates. I called the get_user_details function with their user ID, and the response came back with their payment methods.

Looking at the payment_methods section, there are two gift cards and three certificates. The gift cards are gift_card_8020792 with $198.00 and gift_card_6136092 with $129.00. The certificates are certificate_3765853 ($500.00), certificate_9984806 ($250.00), and certificate_2765295 ($250.00). 

I need to sum the gift cards first. $198 plus $129 is $327. Then the certificates: $500 + $250 + $250 equals $1,000. The total for both would be $327 + $1,000, which is $1,327. 

I should present each category's total separately and then the overall total. Make sure to mention each gift card and certificate's amount as well. The user might want to know individual balances in case they need specific info. Also, check if there's any other payment method they might have, but the response only lists those. Alright, time to format the answer clearly.
</think>

Here are your gift card and certificate balances:

**Gift Cards:**
- gift_card_8020792: $198.00
- gift_card_6136092: $129.00  
**Total Gift Cards:** $327.00

**Certificates:**
- certificate_3765853: $500.00
- certificate_9984806: $250.00
- certificate_2765295: $250.00  
**Total Certificates:** $1,000.00

**Combined Total:** $1,327.00

Let me know if you'd like to use any of these for a booking!

Thank you for the details! Just to confirm, the total on my gift cards is $327.00 and the total on my certificates is $1,000.00, correct? 

Now, I’d like to change my upcoming reservation. I want to keep the same travel dates, but I’d like to switch to the cheapest available business class round trip, whether it’s direct or has connections. Can you help me with that?
